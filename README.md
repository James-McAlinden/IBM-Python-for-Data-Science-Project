# IBM-Python-for-Data-Science-Project

This was a course where I demonstrated key Python skills for working with data. These key skills included extracting data, web scraping, visualising data, and creating a dashboard.

In regard to web scraping, I used the Python library Beautiful Soup to extract data out of HTML and XML files. Additionally, I used read_html to scrape data from HTML tables into a data frame.

Afterwards, I analysed revenue data and built a dashboard for Tesla and GME. To do this, I first used yfinance to extract stock data for Tesla and GME. Secondly, I parsed the html data using Beautiful Soup. 

Thirdly, I used Beautiful Soup or the read_html function to extract the table with the Tesla revenue and GME revenue and stored it into a data frame.

Finally, I used the make_graph function to graph the Tesla stock data and the GameStop stock data.
